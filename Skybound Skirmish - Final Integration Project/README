Skybound Skirmish

Project Outline

Skybound Skirmish is an engaging browser-based game where players take control of a biplane to battle enemy drones in a thrilling aerial skirmish. The objective is to navigate the sky using a joystick connected via an Arduino or keyboard controls, shooting down two types of enemies—swarm drones and bombers—while avoiding being overwhelmed. Players start with three lives and have 90 seconds to achieve the highest score possible by destroying enemies. The game features three scenes: a welcome screen to start, the main gameplay area, and a game-over screen displaying the final score. A buzzer buzzes whenever an enemy is destroyed, providing satisfying feedback, and dynamic audio enhances the experience with background music and explosion sounds.

Arduino Board Setup

The game uses an Arduino to interface with a joystick and buzzer, providing physical feedback during play. Below is a photo of the setup along with the pin connections:

Thoughts About Future Development

Skybound Skirmish has plenty of room to grow! Future enhancements could include:





Adding new enemy types with unique behaviors, like evasive maneuvers or counterattacks.



Introducing power-ups, such as temporary shields or faster firing rates, to add strategic depth.



Enhancing the audio with more dynamic sound effects, like engine noises that change with speed.



Implementing a high-score leaderboard to encourage replayability.



Exploring a two-player mode, either cooperative or competitive, to make the skies even more exciting.
